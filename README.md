# Public dataset

To further validate the performance of our proposed framework, we conduct prediction experiment on the public dataset using the TCGA-KIRC , TCGA-KICH, and TCGA-KIRP datasets from the Cancer Imaging Archive, which specifically contain cases of ccRCC, chRCC, and pRCC, respectively. We select 56 cases that have both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences for validation. All included case IDs are as follows:

| Dataset   | Case ID                                                      |
